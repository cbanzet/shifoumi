The goal is to create a rock paper scissors game in Angular.

The game will be divided in two or three screens :

- Player name screen :
  As a player, I want to be able to type in my name in a text field and to click on a "continue" button to access the game.
- Game screen :
  As a player, I want to be able to click on an image of a rock, a paper or a scissors to play. Then, I want to see if I won by displaying the computer's choice. Finally, I want to be able to see my score (1 win = 1 point) and to see the computer's score.
- Ranking :
  As a player, I want to be able to see my ranking against other players that filled a different name than mine (ranking can be expressed with a percentage of my wins against the computer for example).

! Using Angular 11
! Application must have automated tests (type and completeness of the test).
